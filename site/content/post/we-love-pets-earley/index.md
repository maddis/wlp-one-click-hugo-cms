Our wonderful We Love Pets Reading branch offer friendly and reliable dog walking, dog sitting, cat sitting and other pet care services in Reading, Arborfield, Shinfield and the surrounding areas. The whole team are fully insured, DBS checked and pet first aid trained, so you know your pet will be safe and happy with us.

We Love Pets Reading all love animals, and genuinely enjoy getting to know your pet to a personal level, so we can create the perfect care plan for your pet’s individual needs. We get to know all pets as thoroughly as we would our own, so they remain happy and comfortable in our presence.

We’ll make sure to talk you through the range of services we offer before deciding on the best fit for you and your pet. We also make sure the team take lots of pictures throughout your pet’s time with us, so you can see how much fun they’re having while you’re not with them.
